# Group Sales Order By Items

## Overview
This module is currently empty and is intended for future implementation. It will be responsible for organizing and grouping sales orders by their items.

## Running the Program

### Current Status
This module is not yet implemented. Once implemented, the running instructions will be updated to include:

1. Prerequisites and dependencies
2. Installation steps
3. Running instructions
4. Expected output
5. Common issues and solutions

### Future Running Instructions
When implemented, the module will be run as follows:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set up environment variables in `.env` (if required):
```
# Environment variables will be specified here
```

3. Run the program:
```bash
python group_sales_order_by_items.py
```

### Expected Future Behavior
- Process sales order data
- Group items by type and quantity
- Generate organized output
- Support batch processing

## Planned Features
- Group sales orders by item type
- Aggregate quantities for similar items
- Generate summary reports
- Support for batch processing

## Future Implementation
The module will be implemented to:
1. Process sales order data
2. Group items by type and quantity
3. Generate organized output for label generation
4. Support efficient batch processing

## Integration
Once implemented, this module will:
- Work with `run_label_generator.py` for label creation
- Support `fetch_label_data.py` for data retrieval
- Provide organized data for the main application

## Dependencies
To be determined based on implementation requirements.

## Notes
- This is a placeholder for future development
- Implementation details will be added as the module is developed
- Will follow the project's coding standards and patterns
